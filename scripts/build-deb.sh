# build-deb.sh — pack the ALREADY-BUILT release binary as a .deb.
#
# Issue #810: ship a .deb alongside the tar.gz on GitHub releases. This is the
# "fairly simple" half of Christian Kastner's split — a release asset a Debian
# user can `dpkg -i`. It is NOT Debian archive packaging: nothing here makes
# any claim about xerj entering the Debian archive (that audit lives in
# docs/PACKAGING_DEBIAN.md).
#
# Design constraint, on purpose: the .deb packs the SAME file the tar.gz packs
# — the binary from the staging directory release.yml already built — so the
# two assets ship a bit-identical executable. That is why this is a plain
# `dpkg-deb --build` over a hand-written pkg root and NOT cargo-deb: cargo-deb
# would rebuild the crate on its own and the .deb could drift from the tar.gz
# the checksums and verify-release.sh vouch for.
#
# The runtime dependency claim is measured, not assumed. TLS is rustls+ring in
# every release target (engine workspace Cargo.toml), so the binary should need
# nothing beyond glibc — but "should" is not a Depends field. The script reads
# the ELF NEEDED entries, refuses to build if anything outside the glibc set
# appears (libssl.so.3 sneaking in via a feature change would otherwise ship a
# .deb that dies on first boot with a missing library), and derives the libc6
# floor from the newest GLIBC_* symbol version the binary actually references.
#
# Only the *-unknown-linux-gnu targets are packaged (→ amd64, arm64). The musl
# targets stay tar.gz-only: a static-musl .deb is unusual and nobody asked.
#
# Usage (exactly what release.yml runs, runnable locally the same way):
#   scripts/build-deb.sh \
#     --stage-dir dist/xerj-1.0.0-rc.76-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
#     --target   x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
#     --version  1.0.0-rc.76 \
#     --out-dir  dist
#
# --stage-dir is the directory the "Stage artifacts (Unix)" step already
# created for the tar.gz: it must hold `xerj`, README.md and LICENSE. The .deb
# is named after the stage dir, so on a tag build (stage xerj-<ver>-<target>)
# the asset is xerj-<ver>-<target>.deb. On a main-push canary build the stage
# dir is named xerj-main-<target> while --version must still be a real
# workspace version ("main" is not a valid Debian version string), so the two
# are passed separately.
#
# Outputs: <out-dir>/<stage-name>.deb and <stage-name>.deb.sha256, in the same
# sha256sum format every other asset uses. Prints `dpkg-deb --info` for the
# build log, so a CI run records exactly what it shipped.
#
# Requires: dpkg-deb, binutils (readelf, objdump), sha256sum.

# Modes of script-created FILES must not depend on the caller's umask: under a
# 077 umask `copyright` would ship 0600 and be unreadable for non-root. (The
# directories are unaffected either way — dpkg-deb records every directory in
# data.tar as 0700 no matter what is on disk, and dpkg creates the real ones
# 0755 at install time; verified both halves against dpkg-deb 1.21.)

Description: single-binary search engine for AI workloads
 XERJ is a search engine written from scratch in Rust that ships as one
 executable: full-text, vector and hybrid search over the same indices,
 built-in agent memory, and log analytics. It also speaks the Elasticsearch
 8.x REST protocol as a compatibility bridge, so existing ES clients work
 unmodified. This package contains the release binary built from
 https://github.com/xerj-org/xerj at version $VERSION.
