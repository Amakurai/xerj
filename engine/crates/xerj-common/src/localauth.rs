//! Local admin-key discovery and the loopback guard that makes it safe.
//!
//! The shipped default config has `[auth] enabled = true`, and the server
//! mints `<data_dir>/admin.key` on first start. Commands that talk to a
//! node from the same machine (`xerj mcp`, `xerj autoindex`, `xerj init`'s
//! advice) can read that file instead of demanding the user paste a key —
//! but only when the target is provably loopback, because a locally
//! readable key sent anywhere else is a credential leak, not a
//! convenience.
//!
//! Both helpers started life in `xerj-autoindex/src/cli.rs` (the autoindex
//! 401 fix); `xerj mcp` hit the identical failure mode (#961), so they
//! moved here rather than being duplicated. The invariants live with the
//! tests in `xerj-autoindex` (`url_is_loopback_is_true_only_for_this_machine`,
//! `userinfo_cannot_disguise_a_remote_host_as_loopback`, and the
//! `discover_local_admin_key` sandbox tests) — the calling crates keep
//! wiring tests of their own.
//!
//! The URL parsing uses a real parser (`url::Url`, the same type reqwest
//! re-exports) rather than string surgery, because the hand-rolled version
//! of this was wrong in a way that leaked credentials: splitting on the
//! last `:` treats the userinfo in `http://localhost:9200@evil.com/` as a
//! host:port pair, judges it loopback, and sends the admin key to
//! `evil.com`. `Url::host_str` resolves that to `evil.com`, which is the
//! whole point of using it.
